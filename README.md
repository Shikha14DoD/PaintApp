# PaintApp
# In this App we want the users to be able to compare the different colours of their choice and choose the one that looks the best for their walls.
# We ask them the colours and display them in different blocks representing the walls. 
# We have also decided that limiting it to 9 walls is the best bet to not confuse them and still give them ample colours and shades to compare.
